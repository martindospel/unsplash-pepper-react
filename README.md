# Unsplash Pepper React

## About
A simple unsplash searching page using unsplash API using React.

## Strategy
* We have used react rather than plain vanilla javascript version this time
  link to last project [here](https://github.com/sayedmurtaza24/unsplash-pepper)
* Saves every search term to `localStorage` and renders a list of 
previously searched terms as suggestions when searching.
